//! The hook lifecycle engine.
//!
//! See `docs/19-plugin-extension-system.md`. A hook observes a lifecycle event
//! and may transform its payload, deny it, ask for approval, inject attributed
//! context, or schedule one follow-up. Three properties keep that from becoming
//! a way around the rest of the system:
//!
//! * **A hook cannot grant.** Outcomes are ordered by how much they restrict.
//!   An `Allow` from an origin that may not grant authority is downgraded to
//!   `Continue` and reported, exactly as `policy::RuleSet::compile` downgrades
//!   a rule. Denying is always permitted: restriction needs no authority.
//! * **A hook cannot loop.** Dispatch is bounded by depth, and a reentrancy key
//!   refuses an event that is already on the stack — which is what a hook that
//!   re-triggers its own event would produce.
//! * **A hook cannot hang.** Every handler runs under the rule's deadline, and
//!   what happens when one fails is decided per event, up front.
