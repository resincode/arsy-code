//! A compact description of the repository, kept between processes.
//!
//! # Why a map, and why it is persistent
//!
//! A model dropped into an unfamiliar repository spends its first several
//! rounds finding out what is in it: list a directory, read a file, grep for a
//! name, read another. That is work the harness has already done — the
//! [knowledge graph](crate::graph) walks the tree, parses what it can, and
//! records every declaration and import — and then throws away when the
//! process exits.
//!
//! So the graph is written to `.arsy/repo-map.json` and re-read at the start
//! of the next turn. Indexing is already incremental: a file whose bytes hash
//! to what was recorded is not reparsed, so refreshing a map of a large
//! repository costs one digest per file rather than one parse per file.
//!
//! # Why the projection is bounded and lossy
//!
//! The graph holds every declaration in the repository. A model's context
//! holds a few thousand tokens of it. A projection that tried to be complete
//! would either be refused by the provider or crowd out the task, so it is
//! explicitly a summary: the files with the most to say, their declarations,
//! and a note naming how much was left out and which tool finds the rest.
//!
//! # What is not in it
//!
//! Only languages the parser has a grammar for contribute declarations.
//! Everything else is still listed as a file — a map that silently omitted the
//! Python half of a repository would be worse than one that says "these files
//! exist, `search.text` reads them", which is what this does.
