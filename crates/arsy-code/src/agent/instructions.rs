//! Which Markdown the model is actually told about.
//!
//! A repository is full of Markdown and almost none of it is an instruction.
//! Injecting every `.md` file would spend the turn's budget on release notes;
//! injecting none, which is what this harness did before, means a project's own
//! conventions never reach the model at all.
//!
//! So discovery is deliberate and narrow: only [`AGENTS_NAMES`], [`CLAUDE_NAME`],
//! and [`FALLBACK_NAME`],
//! only on the path from the workspace root down to the working directory, root
//! first — the same ancestor walk `arsy integrations import` reports, so what
//! the model is told and what `arsy integrations explain` prints cannot drift.
//! Everything else is documentation the model can choose to read with
//! `search.text` and `fs.read`, which is the point of having those tools.
